Hey Jeff, this is Ryan. Thanks for the Rainer Hahnekamp recommendation! I watched his YouTube video "Signals Unleashed: The Full Guide" to get a more in-depth understanding of signal implementation and how it can be integrated with NgRx. Over in S2 Policy Servicing, we've been trying to figure out ways to refactor existing code into signal-based implementations. The last couple innovation sprints have been opportunities for me to initiate some research and some messing around to see how easy/difficult it would be to do these conversions. Your class helped provide some additional context regarding proper usage, and I will absolutely request to take your class on Angular State Management.
